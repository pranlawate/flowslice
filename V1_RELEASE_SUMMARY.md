   - Add publisher for `flowslice` project
   - Owner: pranlawate
   - Repo: flowslice
   - Workflow: publish.yml
   - Environment: pypi

### üìù Commit History (This Session)

1. `713cfbf` - Add comprehensive tests for comprehension tracking
2. `aebc383` - Add performance caching for AST parsing and imports
3. `59df810` - Prepare v1.0.0 release

### üîß Technical Details

**New Features**:
- Mtime-based AST cache in Slicer (`_ast_cache`, `_func_cache`)
- Mtime-based caching in ImportResolver (`ast_cache`, `import_cache`)
- Helper methods: `_parse_file_cached()`, `_get_function_definitions_cached()`
- Comprehension test coverage for all types

**Build Configuration**:
- Hatch build system with smart excludes
- Development docs excluded from package
- Only essential files in source distribution
- Tests included for verification

**Quality Metrics**:
- All linting passes (ruff)
- Type checking compliant (mypy)
- No failing tests
- Good test coverage (68%)

### üéÅ Deliverables

Files created/modified this session:

**Created**:
- `tests/unit/test_comprehensions.py` - 170 lines
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Comprehensive release notes
- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- `RELEASE.md` - Release checklist and instructions
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - PyPI publishing workflow
- `V1_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Modified**:
- `pyproject.toml` - Version, metadata, build config
- `src/flowslice/__init__.py` - Version update
- `src/flowslice/core/slicer.py` - Performance caching
- `src/flowslice/core/import_resolver.py` - Performance caching

### üí° Key Insights

1. **Comprehensions Work**: The NEXT_SESSION.md incorrectly stated comprehensions needed fixes - they were already fully functional
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Using mtime is simple and effective for single-developer projects
3. **Package Size**: Excluding dev docs reduces package from many MB to essentials
4. **Test Quality**: Edge case testing revealed the comprehensions were solid

### üéì Lessons Learned

- Always verify claims in handoff documents with actual testing
- AST caching can significantly improve performance
- Proper package configuration matters for user experience
- Comprehensive tests catch issues early
