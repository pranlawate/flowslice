# Naming Decision for PySlice Project

## ðŸ”¥ The Problem

After checking **200+ name variations**, virtually EVERYTHING is taken on PyPI! This is actually a GOOD sign - it means:
- Static analysis is a popular/important area
- Dataflow analysis has demand
- The space is competitive (validates our idea!)

## ðŸ’¡ Recommended Solutions

### Option A: Keep Working Name, Focus on Quality

**Recommendation: Use `pyslice` anyway** (or with qualifier)

**Why?**
- The existing `pyslice` package (https://pypi.org/project/pyslice/) is completely different - it's for creating input datasets, NOT code analysis
- Users searching for "Python slicing tool" will find both
- Differentiate with clear description and better tool
- Focus on building great tool first, marketing second

**Possible variations:**
- `pyslice-analyzer`
- `pyslice-defuse`
- `pyslice-tool`
- `py-slice-analyzer`

### Option B: Rebrand with Available Unique Name

Since almost everything is taken, we need to check less obvious combinations. Here are strategies:

#### 1. **Use Numbers/Version in Name**
- `slicepy3`
- `pyslice2`
- `flowslice3`

#### 2. **Use Uncommon Suffixes**
- `slicify-tool`
- `py-slice-dev`
- `slicepy-dev`

#### 3. **Use GitHub Username Pattern**
- `<yourname>-pyslice`
- `<yourname>-dataflow`

#### 4. **Make Up Completely New Word**
Think: Google, Uber, Spotify - meaningless but brandable
- `pyslizio`
- `slicora`
- `tracora`
- `flowora`
- `codeora`
