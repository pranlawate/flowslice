# Naming Research Archive

**Archived**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Historical reference only

## What's Here

This directory contains the naming research documents created during Phase 0. These files are kept for historical reference but have been **superseded** by the final decision.

### Archived Files:

1. **AVAILABLE_NAMES.md** - Initial list of available names (before scope filtering)
2. **NAME_FINAL_ANALYSIS.md** - Early analysis focusing on varscout/varquest
3. **NAME_INTUITIVENESS_ANALYSIS.md** - Intuitiveness analysis that led to flowslice
4. **NAME_RESEARCH_2025.md** - Research when we thought all names were taken (flawed testing)
5. **NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md** - Original naming brainstorm (200+ names)
6. **NAMING_DECISION.md** - Early naming strategy

### Why Archived:

- **Superseded**: Final decision documented in `/NAMING_FINAL.md`
- **Redundant**: Multiple iterations covering same ground
- **Historical**: Useful for understanding decision process, not current reference

## Current Naming Documentation

**Active file**: `/NAMING_FINAL.md`

**Decision**: **flowslice**

**Rationale**:
- Perfect alignment with core concepts (dataflow + slicing)
- Available on all platforms (PyPI, GitHub, domains)
- Industry-standard terminology
- Score: 10/10

## Research Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Research (Oct 2-3)
- Tested 200+ names manually
- Used flawed curl testing (all appeared taken)
- Documented in: NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md, NAMING_DECISION.md

### Phase 2: Corrected Testing (Oct 27)
- Fixed testing methodology
- Discovered 67 names actually available
- Documented in: AVAILABLE_NAMES.md, NAME_RESEARCH_2025.md

### Phase 3: Scope Filtering (Oct 27)
- Filtered 67 names by alignment with project scope
- Narrowed to 4 top candidates
- Questioned intuitiveness of initial favorites
- Documented in: NAME_FINAL_ANALYSIS.md, NAME_INTUITIVENESS_ANALYSIS.md

### Phase 4: Final Decision (Oct 27)
- Identified "flowslice" as perfect name
- Validated availability across all platforms
- Made final decision
- Documented in: /NAMING_FINAL.md ← **CURRENT**

## Key Learnings

1. **Testing matters**: Initial curl test was flawed
2. **Question assumptions**: User caught the testing flaw
3. **Scope alignment critical**: Most "available" names didn't fit the tool
4. **Industry terms win**: Professional terminology > creative names

**If you need naming history, read these files in order:**
1. NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md (original brainstorm)
2. NAME_RESEARCH_2025.md (flawed testing revelation)
3. AVAILABLE_NAMES.md (corrected testing)
4. NAME_INTUITIVENESS_ANALYSIS.md (scope analysis)
5. **→ /NAMING_FINAL.md** (FINAL DECISION)

**For current status, read ONLY**: `/NAMING_FINAL.md`
