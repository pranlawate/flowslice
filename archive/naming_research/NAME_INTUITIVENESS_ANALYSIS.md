# Name Intuitiveness Analysis

**Question**: Is the name intuitive and applies to most of the things we do?

---

## What Does This Tool Actually Do?

Based on the README and POC, the tool does:

1. **Backward Slicing** - Where did this variable value come from?
2. **Forward Slicing** - Where does this variable value go?
3. **Dataflow Analysis** - Track how data flows through code
4. **Dependency Tracking** - What variables depend on what
5. **Program Slicing** - Show relevant subset of code for a variable

**Core Concepts**: Slicing, Dataflow, Tracing, Variables, Code Flow

## Name Analysis: Do They Match?

### ‚ùå **varscout** - NOT GREAT FIT

**What "scout" implies**:
- Looking around, exploring
- Searching for something
- Reconnaissance

**What the tool actually does**:
- ‚úÖ Finds variables (good match)
- ‚ùå Doesn't just "scout" - it traces complete flows
- ‚ùå "Scout" feels too exploratory/searching
- ‚ùå Doesn't capture the "slicing" or "flow" aspect

**Verdict**: Too narrow - focuses on finding, not on slicing/flow

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **varquest** - PARTIAL FIT

**What "quest" implies**:
- Journey to find something
- Adventure/exploration
- Going from point A to B

**What the tool actually does**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Quest" for variable origins (backward slice)
- ‚ùå Doesn't capture forward slicing well
- ‚ùå Too whimsical for the actual functionality
- ‚ùå Doesn't mention "slice" or "flow"

**Verdict**: Creative but doesn't fully capture slicing concept

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **vartracer** - BETTER FIT

**What "tracer" implies**:
- Following a path/trail
- Tracking something through a system
- Tracing execution or flow

**What the tool actually does**:
- ‚úÖ Traces variable flow (good match!)
- ‚úÖ Follows data through code (good match!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't explicitly mention "slicing"
- ‚úÖ Works for both forward and backward

**Verdict**: Good fit for tracing, but "tracer" is also used for debuggers/profilers

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **sliceview** - PARTIAL FIT

**What "sliceview" implies**:
- Viewing slices of code
- Seeing a subset

**What the tool actually does**:
- ‚úÖ Shows program slices (good match!)
- ‚úÖ Visualization/viewing (good match!)
- ‚ùå Doesn't capture the "variable" or "dataflow" aspect
- ‚ùå Could be confused with viewing code snippets

**Verdict**: Captures "slice" but not the variable/dataflow focus

---

### ‚ùå **variableflow** - TOO GENERIC

**What "variableflow" implies**:
- How variables flow through code
- Data flow of variables

**What the tool actually does**:
- ‚úÖ Tracks variable flow (exact match!)
- ‚ùå BUT: Doesn't capture "slicing" methodology
- ‚ùå Too long and generic
- ‚ùå Doesn't distinguish from general dataflow analysis

**Verdict**: Descriptive but doesn't capture the slicing technique

---

## What Name SHOULD Capture

The tool is fundamentally about:

1. **Program Slicing** ‚Üê Core technique
2. **For Variables** ‚Üê Focus
3. **Dataflow Analysis** ‚Üê What it analyzes
4. **Bidirectional** ‚Üê Backward + Forward

**Ideal name should suggest**: Slicing variables to understand flow

---

## Better Name Suggestions

Let me reconsider what would be MORE intuitive:

### Option 1: Keep "Slice" in the Name

**Why**: "Slicing" is the actual computer science term for this technique

1. **`flowslice`** ‚ú® BEST FIT
   - "Flow" = dataflow
   - "Slice" = program slicing technique
   - Captures both core concepts!
   - Check availability ‚¨áÔ∏è

2. **`dataslice`**
   - "Data" = focuses on data flow
   - "Slice" = the technique
   - Clear and professional

3. **`codeslice`**
   - "Code" = what it analyzes
   - "Slice" = the technique
   - Simple and clear

### Option 2: Emphasize "Flow"

4. **`traceflow`**
   - "Trace" = following the path
   - "Flow" = dataflow
   - Dynamic sounding

5. **`codeflow`**
   - "Code" = what it analyzes
   - "Flow" = dataflow analysis
   - Simple and professional

### Option 3: Combine Slice + Flow + Variable

6. **`sliceflow`**
   - Combines the two key concepts
   - Professional
   - Clear purpose

## Comparison to Original "PySlice"

### Why "flowslice" is BETTER than "pyslice":

1. **No name conflict**: "pyslice" already taken by template engine
2. **More descriptive**: "flow" adds meaning
3. **Language agnostic**: Could expand beyond Python
4. **Professional**: Combines two CS terms properly
5. **Available everywhere**: No platform conflicts

### Why it's not worse:

- Still captures "slice" concept ‚úÖ
- Shorter than "pyslice-anything" ‚úÖ
- More professional than "py-" prefix ‚úÖ
- Follows industry naming (like `dataflow`, `airflow`, etc.) ‚úÖ

## Final Recommendation

### üèÜ **flowslice** - THE CLEAR WINNER

**Tagline**: "Flow Through Your Code, One Slice at a Time"

**Or**: "Slice Into Your Dataflow"

**Package name**: `flowslice`
**Import**: `import flowslice`
**CLI**: `flowslice file.py:42:var both`
**Website**: flowslice.dev
**GitHub**: github.com/flowslice/flowslice

**Branding**:

2. Reserve on PyPI (create placeholder)
3. Create GitHub org: github.com/flowslice
4. Register domain: flowslice.dev
5. Update all documentation
6. Proceed to Phase 1 development
