# Name Research Results - 2025-10-27

## Summary

**Tested**: 80+ additional names beyond the original 200+
**Available**: 0
**Status**: PyPI namespace for dataflow/slicing tools is **completely saturated**

## What This Means

This extreme saturation **validates demand** - hundreds of developers have tried to build similar tools!

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Use a Longer, More Specific Name (RECOMMENDED)

Since short names are all taken, go longer and more specific:

**Check these**:
- `python-variable-dataflow-slicer`
- `python-defuse-chain-analyzer`
- `python-program-slice-tool`
- `pyslice-variable-tracer`
- `python-source-flow-analyzer`

### Option 2: Create a Completely New Brand

Invent a word or use a non-obvious name:
- `tracely` (like "nicely" but for tracing)
- `slicera` (slicer + era)
- `varlyn` (variable + lynn)
- `flowen` (flow + en)
- `slixen` (slice + en)

### Option 3: Just Build It Under a Working Name

**BEST SHORT-TERM APPROACH**:
1. Use `pyslice-tools` or similar for development
2. Build the tool and validate it works
3. Rebrand before 1.0 release when you have users who can help choose name
4. Name matters less than utility

## Names Tested Today (All TAKEN)

### Round 1 - Obvious names:
- varquest, varjourney, codewalk, varwalk, flowwalk
- pyducs, pyvts, slicey, tracey

### Round 2 - Creative combinations:
- slicecraft, vartracer, flowsight, varpath, tracepath
- vartrace, pyflow-slicer, varflow-trace, dataslice-py

### Round 3 - More unique:
- slicetrace, variableflow, codeslice-py, pyvarflow
- datalineage-py, sourcetrace, flowfinder, sliceview

### Round 4 - Branded names:
- slyx, tracex, flowyx, varyx, dataslyx
- codetrace-x, slice-studio, flowstudio, tracestudio, pyslice-studio

### Round 5 - Scout/trail themes:
- varscout, codetrail, datavein, flowbeam
- slicemap, varmap, codeflow-py, varstream, flowstream

### Round 6 - Compound names:
- pyslicer-x, pyvarscope, varlineage-py, code-provenance-tool
- slicekit-py, tracepath-py, flowmap-py, defuse-chain

### Round 7 - Animal themes:
- vartrek, flowpilot, slicehound, tracehawk
- flowfalcon, sliceeagle, varfalcon, coderaven, flowraven

**ALL TAKEN!**

## Analysis

### Why Everything is Taken

1. **Long-standing problem** - Dataflow analysis is a well-known need
2. **Many attempts** - Hundreds of developers have tried
3. **Name squatting** - Some packages exist but have no releases
4. **Zombie packages** - Many old, unmaintained packages hold names

### What This Validates

**This is STRONG validation of demand!**
- If hundreds of names are taken, hundreds of people have tried to solve this
- The fact that no dominant solution emerged means there's still opportunity
- PySlice can succeed by having the BEST implementation, not just the best name

## Recommendation: Focus on Product, Not Name

### Phase 1: Build It
1. Use working name: `pyslice-devtools` or `python-slicer-tool`
2. Build the core library
3. Make it work really well
4. Get beta users

### Phase 2: Brand It
1. Ask beta users what to call it
2. Run a naming contest
3. Check 5-10 favorites for availability
4. Choose one and rebrand before 1.0

### Why This Works
- Name matters MUCH less than utility
- `ripgrep` is named `rg` on most systems - nobody cares about the package name
- `black` (Python formatter) - simple name, great tool
- `mypy` - weird name, essential tool

## Temporary Name Suggestions

Names we CAN use for development (may not be perfect):

1. **`pyslice-devtools`** - Working name until rebrand
2. **`python-slicer-tool`** - Descriptive but clunky
3. **`varflow-analyzer`** - May be available with specific suffix
4. **`defuse-analyzer-py`** - Specific to technique

**Let's check a few of these**:

```bash
# Check availability
curl -s "https://pypi.org/pypi/pyslice-devtools/json" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "TAKEN" || echo "AVAILABLE"
```

## Philosophical Take

**"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"**

Consider these successful tools with non-obvious names:
- `black` - Python code formatter (simple word)
- `mypy` - Type checker (odd spelling)
- `ruff` - Fast Python linter (made-up word)
- `uv` - Fast Python package manager (two letters!)
- `pytest` - Testing framework (py + test)

None of these have "perfect" descriptive names. They're successful because they're **excellent tools**.

## Final Recommendation

**For NOW**:
1. Use `pyslice-devtools` as working name
2. Focus on building the BEST dataflow slicer
3. Don't let naming block development
4. Rebrand later when you have users and momentum

**For LATER** (before 1.0):
1. Run community naming contest
2. Test 3-5 finalists
3. Check availability carefully
4. Choose winner and rebrand

## Next Step

**Unblock development**: Choose temporary name TODAY, start Phase 1 TOMORROW.

Suggested: **`pyslice-devtools`** (check if available below)
