# 👋 START HERE - PySlice Project

## If You're Reading This...

You (or someone) is returning to this project! Welcome back! 🎉

## ⚡ Quick Context (30 seconds)

**What is this?**
PySlice is a Python dataflow analysis tool that traces where variables come from and where they go - showing function names, not just line numbers.

**Status:**
✅ Working proof-of-concept
📋 Full roadmap ready
🔍 Next step: Research existing tools (Phase 0)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Test the Proof of Concept (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/plawate/git_space/flowslice

# Try the demo
python flowslice_poc.py example.py:25:result both

# Or test on real code (the isort fix we made)
python flowslice_poc.py /home/plawate/git_space/isort/isort/main.py:1251:skipped both
```

### 2. Read the Context (5 minutes)

```bash
# Read this first for full context
cat CONTEXT.md

# Then check the roadmap
cat ROADMAP.md
```

### 3. Start Phase 0 Research (Next Step!)

**Before building more, CHECK if existing tools do what we need!**

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) Phase 0 for details.

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Option A: Continue Building PySlice

1. ✅ **Phase 0: Research existing tools** (CRITICAL FIRST STEP!)
   - Test pyan3, Sourcegraph, Semgrep, etc.
   - Document what they can/can't do
   - Decide if we need to build this

2. Choose a name (see NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md)

3. Set up proper package structure

4. Follow ROADMAP.md Phase 1

### Option B: Just Explore

1. Play with the POC
2. Test on different codebases
3. Think about use cases
4. Give feedback

### Option C: Different Direction

Maybe after research you decide:
- Existing tool is good enough → use that!
- Better to contribute to existing project
- Different problem to solve

## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Why did we build this?

**A:** Started while fixing isort #2412. Needed to trace how the `skipped` variable flowed through multiple files. Manual analysis was tedious, so we built a tool!

### Q: Does this already exist?

**A:** **WE DON'T KNOW YET!** That's Phase 0 - checking existing tools. After testing 200+ PyPI names, they ALL exist, but we haven't tested if they actually do dataflow slicing.

### Q: What makes this different?

**A:** (If we build it)
- ✅ Function-aware (shows function names)
- ✅ Bidirectional (backward + forward slicing)
- ✅ Beautiful output (tree visualization)
- ✅ Easy CLI (`flowslice file.py:42:var`)

### Q: Should I build this?

**A:** **Do Phase 0 first!** Research existing tools. Then decide.

### Q: What if existing tools are good enough?

**A:** Great! Use them. Maybe contribute. This was a fun learning exercise anyway!

### Q: What about the name?

**A:** Almost everything on PyPI is taken. See NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md. Decide after Phase 0 research.

## 🔧 Development Setup (If Continuing)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/plawate/git_space/flowslice

# Test the POC
python flowslice_poc.py example.py:25:result both

# Create proper package (after Phase 0)
mkdir -p src/flowslice tests docs
# ... follow ROADMAP.md Phase 1
```

## 📞 Context from Original Session

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Original Task:** Fix isort issue #2412
**Discovery:** Need for dataflow analysis tool
**Outcome:**
- ✅ Fixed isort issue (3 locations)
- ✅ Built PySlice proof of concept
- ✅ Complete project plan

**Key Insight:** After testing 200+ names on PyPI, almost EVERYTHING dataflow-related is taken. This actually VALIDATES demand for such tools!

## 🎓 What We Learned

1. **AST-based slicing works** - Fast and accurate
2. **Demand exists** - PyPI namespace crowded
3. **Manual analysis is tedious** - Tool would be useful
4. **Research first** - Don't reinvent the wheel

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### BEFORE Building More:

1. ✅ **Research existing tools** (Phase 0 in ROADMAP.md)
2. ✅ **Validate user demand** (survey developers)
3. ✅ **Choose final name** (check availability)
4. ✅ **Test POC on real code** (find edge cases)

### DON'T:

- ❌ Build VS Code extension first (do CLI first)
- ❌ Optimize prematurely (get it working first)
- ❌ Bikeshed the name forever (pick something, move on)
- ❌ Reinvent wheels (use existing tools if they work)

**How will you know this was worth it?**

### Minimum (Learning):
- ✅ Learned about AST analysis
- ✅ Learned about dataflow slicing
- ✅ Built working POC

### Good (Tool):
- 🎯 1000+ GitHub stars
- 🎯 10k+ pip installs/month

## 📝 Final Thoughts

This project has **real potential**. The proof-of-concept works, the roadmap is clear, and the need is validated (by how crowded PyPI is!).

**But:** Do Phase 0 research first! Don't build if existing tools are good enough.

**Good luck!** 🚀
