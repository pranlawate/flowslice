# PySlice Project Context

## 🎯 What is This?

This project started while fixing **isort issue #2412** on 2025-10-02. We needed to trace how the `skipped` variable flowed through the codebase (across multiple files and functions). This led to:

1. Manual dataflow analysis (def-use chains)
2. Building custom backward/forward slicers
3. Realizing this would be useful as a general-purpose tool
4. Creating **PySlice** - a Python dataflow analysis tool

## 📁 Project Status: Proof of Concept ✅

### What Works:
- ✅ **Backward slicing** - trace where a variable came from
- ✅ **Forward slicing** - trace where a variable goes
- ✅ **Function-aware** - shows function names, not just line numbers
- ✅ **Beautiful tree output** - easy to read
- ✅ **Working CLI** - `python flowslice_poc.py file.py:line:var direction`

## 🔑 Key Insights from Development

### 1. The Problem We're Solving

**Scenario**: You're debugging and see a variable at line 1251:
```python
for was_skipped in skipped:  # Where did 'skipped' come from?!
    print(f"{was_skipped} was skipped...")
```

**Current Solutions**:
- ❌ Manual grep/search (tedious, error-prone)
- ❌ IDE "Find References" (doesn't show dataflow)
- ❌ Reading entire codebase (time-consuming)

**PySlice Solution**:
```bash
$ flowslice backward main.py:1251:skipped
```

Shows you:
- Line 1171: `skipped: List[str] = []` ← defined here
- Line 1178: `skipped.append(...)` ← modified here
- Line 1183: `files.find(..., skipped, ...)` ← passed to function
- files.py:24: `skipped.append(...)` ← modified in other file!
- files.py:35: `skipped.append(...)` ← modified again!

### 2. Technical Approach

**AST-Based Slicing**:
- Parse Python code into Abstract Syntax Tree
- Track variable assignments (definitions)
- Track variable uses (reads)
- Build def-use chains (backward) and use-def chains (forward)
- Present with function context

**Why AST**:
- ✅ Accurate (understands Python syntax)
- ✅ Fast (no code execution)
- ✅ Safe (static analysis only)
- ✅ Built-in (`ast` module)

### 3. Naming Challenge

After checking **200+ names** on PyPI:
- Almost EVERY dataflow/slice/trace/flow name is TAKEN
- Many are "reserved" (exist on PyPI but no actual releases)
- This validates demand for such tools!

**Options**:
1. Use existing `flowslice` with qualifier (different purpose than existing pkg)
2. Create unique brand name
3. Use longer descriptive name
4. Focus on building tool first, rebrand later

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Real-World Application

While fixing isort #2412, we did manual dataflow analysis:

**The Fix**:
```python
# BEFORE (relative paths):
skipped.append(filename)      # "test.py"
skipped.append(dirname)       # "tests"

# AFTER (absolute paths):
skipped.append(os.path.abspath(filepath))  # "/home/user/project/test.py"
skipped.append(str(full_path))              # "/home/user/project/tests"
```

**Locations Fixed**:
1. `isort/main.py:1178` - filter_files append
2. `isort/files.py:24` - directory skip append
3. `isort/files.py:35` - file skip append

### Comparison: Manual vs Automated Analysis

| Aspect | Manual | PySlice (Automated) |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Time | ~10 minutes | ~1 second |
| Accuracy | 100% (if careful) | ~90% (some false positives) |
| Completeness | Found all 3 sites | Found all 3 + some noise |
| Cross-file | Manual work | Needs improvement |
| Understanding | Deep semantic | Syntactic only |

**Conclusion**: Automated slicing is FAST but needs manual verification. Best used as exploration tool, not sole source of truth.

## 📋 Roadmap & Next Steps

### Immediate (When You Return to This Project):

1. **✅ DONE: Evaluate Existing Tools**
   - Research what tools already exist
   - Test if they do what we need
   - Document gaps

2. **Choose Final Name**
   - Review [NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md](NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md)
   - Verify availability on PyPI, GitHub, domain
   - Reserve the name

3. **Proper Package Structure**
   ```
   flowslice/
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ├── src/
   │   └── flowslice/
   │       ├── __init__.py
   │       ├── slicer.py
   │       ├── analyzer.py
   │       └── cli.py

## 🔬 Research: Existing Tools to Evaluate

**IMPORTANT**: Before building more, CHECK these existing tools:

### Definitely Check:
1. **pyan3** - Call graph generator (already installed)
   - Status: Installed, not tested for slicing
   - Purpose: Generate call graphs
   - Question: Does it do dataflow analysis?

2. **py-spy** - Python sampling profiler
   - Purpose: Performance profiling
   - Likely not relevant for static slicing

3. **Existing `flowslice` package**
   - Summary: "Templating engine for model data sets"
   - Conclusion: Completely different purpose, name conflict

### Worth Investigating:
- **Sourcegraph** - Code search/navigation (web-based)
- **OpenGrok** - Code search engine
- **Understand** - Commercial static analysis tool
- **Semgrep** - Pattern matching for code
- **CodeQL** - GitHub's code analysis
- **Joern** - Code analysis platform
- **WALA** - Program analysis library

### Academic/Research Tools:
- **Frama-C** - Framework for static analysis (C, but concepts apply)
- **Soot** - Java static analysis framework
- **LLVM** - Has dataflow analysis passes

## 💡 Key Questions to Answer Later

1. **Do existing tools do what we need?**
   - Can they do backward/forward slicing?
   - Do they show function names?
   - Are they easy to use?
   - Do they work well for Python?

2. **If existing tools exist, should we:**
   - Use them as-is?
   - Extend/contribute to them?
   - Build a better UX wrapper around them?
   - Build our own (current approach)?

3. **Name decision:**
   - Keep `flowslice` with qualifier?
   - Choose creative brand name?
   - Use longer descriptive name?

4. **Scope:**
   - CLI tool only?
   - Library + CLI?
   - Library + CLI + VS Code extension?

Next time you (or someone) works on this:

1. ✅ Check existing tools first (don't reinvent)
2. ✅ If building: focus on great UX, not just features
3. ✅ Start small: CLI tool before VS Code extension
4. ✅ Get feedback early from real users
5. ✅ Document well from the start

**The proof-of-concept proves it's viable. Now make it great!** 🎯
