# Phase 0 Research - GO/NO-GO Decision

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DECISION MADE: GO**

---

## Executive Summary

After researching existing Python dataflow analysis tools, **the decision is to proceed with building PySlice**.

**Finding**: No existing tool provides variable-level dataflow slicing with backward/forward analysis via a simple CLI.

**Recommendation**: Build PySlice as planned, but choose a different name (existing "flowslice" package is a template engine).

---

## Tools Evaluated

| Tool | Type | Dataflow Slicing? | Verdict |
|------|------|-------------------|---------|
| pyan3 | Call graph generator | ‚ùå No (also broken) | Not a replacement |
| code2flow | Flowchart generator | ‚ùå Function-level only | Complementary, not replacement |
| Semgrep | Pattern matcher | ‚ùå Pattern-based, not dataflow | Different purpose |
| astroid | AST library | ‚ùå Library, not tool | Could help build PySlice |
| flowslice (existing) | Template engine | ‚ùå Unrelated tool | NAME CONFLICT |
| PyCharm | IDE | ‚ö†Ô∏è Reference finding only | Not scriptable |
| VS Code | IDE | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic references | Not scriptable |

**Full details**: See [TOOL_COMPARISON.md](TOOL_COMPARISON.md)

## Why Build PySlice?

### 1. Clear Market Gap

**What exists**:
- Call graph generators (pyan3, code2flow)
- Pattern matchers (Semgrep)
- IDE reference finders (PyCharm, VS Code)

**What's missing**:
- ‚úÖ Variable-level dataflow slicing
- ‚úÖ Backward slice (where did this value come from?)
- ‚úÖ Forward slice (where does this value go?)
- ‚úÖ Dependency chains
- ‚úÖ Simple CLI tool

### 2. Unique Value Proposition

PySlice answers questions that NO other tool answers:

**Q: "Where did the value in variable X at line Y come from?"**
- pyan3: ‚ùå Can't answer (function-level only)
- code2flow: ‚ùå Can't answer (shows calls, not dataflow)
- PyCharm: ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows references, not dataflow chain
- **PySlice: ‚úÖ Shows complete backward slice with dependencies**

**Q: "If I change variable X at line Y, what will be affected?"**
- Semgrep: ‚ùå Can't answer (pattern matching)
- VS Code: ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows references, not impact chain
- **PySlice: ‚úÖ Shows complete forward slice**

### 3. Validated Demand

**Evidence of demand**:
1. PyPI namespace crowded with dataflow-related names (200+ tested, all taken)
2. Real-world need (born from isort #2412 debugging)
3. IDEs have reference finding, but not scriptable dataflow analysis
4. No open-source CLI tool for this use case

### 4. Working Proof-of-Concept

- ‚úÖ Backward slicing works
- ‚úÖ Forward slicing works
- ‚úÖ Function-aware output
- ‚úÖ Beautiful tree visualization
- ‚úÖ Simple CLI interface

## Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Existing tool is good enough?** | ‚ùå No | No tool does variable-level dataflow slicing |
| **Positive user demand?** | ‚úÖ Yes | Born from real need, validated by crowded namespace |
| **Clear differentiation?** | ‚úÖ Yes | Only tool that does this specific analysis |
| **Available name secured?** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | "flowslice" taken, need different name |
| **POC works?** | ‚úÖ Yes | Fully functional proof-of-concept |
| **Real use case?** | ‚úÖ Yes | Debugging isort #2412 |

**Result**: 5 out of 6 criteria met (name issue is solvable)

---

## ‚úÖ GO Decision

### Proceed to Phase 1: Core Library Development

**Confidence Level**: High

**Reasoning**:
1. Clear market gap - no competition
2. Validated demand - real use case
3. Working POC - technical feasibility proven
4. Unique value - answers questions others can't
5. Complementary - works alongside existing tools

### Remaining Blockers

**CRITICAL BLOCKER**: Name decision
- Cannot use "flowslice" (taken by template engine)
- Must choose new name before PyPI publication
- See [NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md](NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md) for options

**Recommendation**: Decide name in next session, then proceed with package structure.

## What We're Building (Clarified)

### YES - Build This:
- ‚úÖ Variable-level dataflow slicer
- ‚úÖ CLI tool for quick analysis
- ‚úÖ Python library (pip installable)
- ‚úÖ Backward + forward slicing
- ‚úÖ Function-aware output
- ‚úÖ Cross-file support
- ‚úÖ Developer debugging tool

### NO - Don't Build This:
- ‚ùå Call graph generator (code2flow exists)
- ‚ùå Pattern matcher (Semgrep exists)
- ‚ùå Full IDE (PyCharm/VS Code exist)
- ‚ùå Enterprise security platform (CodeQL exists)
- ‚ùå Profiler (py-spy exists)
- ‚ùå Debugger (pdb exists)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (This Week):

1. **Choose final name** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER
   - Review [NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md](NAME_SUGGESTIONS.md)
   - Check availability on PyPI, GitHub, domain
   - Make decision and reserve name

2. **Set up package structure**
   - Create proper Python package layout
   - Set up pyproject.toml
   - Configure linting, testing, CI/CD

3. **Refactor POC into library**
   - Extract core slicing logic
   - Add type hints
   - Write comprehensive docstrings
   - Create clean API

### Phase 1 (Next 4-6 weeks):

4. **Add tests** (target >80% coverage)
5. **Improve accuracy** (type-aware analysis)
6. **Cross-file support** (inter-procedural analysis)
7. **Performance optimization**
8. **Documentation**

### Phase 2 (Following 2-3 weeks):

9. **Production CLI**
10. **Multiple output formats** (JSON, HTML, DOT)
11. **Configuration file support**

### Phase 3 (After MVP):

12. **Publish to PyPI**
13. **Documentation website**
14. **Announcement** (Reddit, HN, Python Weekly)
