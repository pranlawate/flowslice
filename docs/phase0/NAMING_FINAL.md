# Final Naming Decision - flowslice ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ✅ FINAL DECISION MADE
**Phase 0**: COMPLETE

---

## 🏆 Final Decision: **flowslice**

**Package**: `flowslice`
**CLI**: `flowslice`
**Import**: `import flowslice`
**GitHub**: github.com/flowslice/flowslice
**Website**: flowslice.dev
**Tagline**: "Dataflow Slicing for Python"

---

## Decision Rationale

### Why flowslice Won

After extensive analysis including:
- Testing 300+ name variations
- Evaluating 67 available names
- Filtering by project scope alignment
- Considering stylistic variants (FloSlyx, FloSlice, etc.)

**flowslice** was chosen because:

1. ✅ **Perfect clarity** - "flow" + "slice" = immediate understanding
2. ✅ **Industry-standard terms** - Uses correct CS terminology
3. ✅ **Professional** - Fits Python ecosystem (black, ruff, mypy, pytest)
4. ✅ **Applies to all features** - Covers backward/forward slicing and dataflow
5. ✅ **Available everywhere** - PyPI, GitHub, domains all available
6. ✅ **Low friction adoption** - Easy to understand, spell, remember
7. ✅ **Future-proof** - Won't feel dated in 5 years

### Alternatives Considered

**Runner-up**: `floslyx` (unique and brandable)
- More memorable and distinctive
- Shorter (7 vs 9 chars)
- Modern tech startup feel
- **Why not chosen**: Clarity and professional adoption more important for dev tools

**Other finalists**:
- `slicetrace`, `dataslice`, `varscout`
- All good options but flowslice scored highest on all criteria

---

## Name Breakdown

**flow** = dataflow analysis (what the tool analyzes)
**slice** = program slicing (the technique it uses)

### Applies to ALL Features ✅

- ✅ **Backward slicing** → "where does this flow FROM?"
- ✅ **Forward slicing** → "where does this flow TO?"
- ✅ **Bidirectional** → "complete flow picture"
- ✅ **Dataflow tracking** → "flow" is explicit
- ✅ **Dependency analysis** → part of dataflow
- ✅ **Cross-file analysis** → tracking flow across files

---

## Platform Availability ✅

| Platform | Status | URL/Package |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **PyPI** | ✅ Available | `pip install flowslice` |
| **GitHub** | ✅ Available | github.com/flowslice |
| **Domain (.dev)** | ✅ Available | flowslice.dev |
| **Domain (.io)** | ✅ Available | flowslice.io |

All verified on 2025-10-27.

## Branding Guidelines

### Package/Technical Usage

**PyPI package**: `flowslice` (lowercase)
```bash
pip install flowslice
```

**CLI command**: `flowslice` (lowercase)
```bash
flowslice file.py:42:var both
flowslice file.py:42:var backward
flowslice file.py:42:var forward
```

**Python import**: `flowslice` (lowercase)
```python
import flowslice
from flowslice import Slicer, analyze
```

### Marketing/Branding Usage

**Title case for branding**: "FlowSlice"
- Documentation titles: "FlowSlice Documentation"
- Marketing: "Introducing FlowSlice"
- Social media: "Check out FlowSlice!"

**Tagline**: "Dataflow Slicing for Python"

**Alternative taglines**:
- "Trace Your Variable Flow"
- "Slice Into Your Dataflow"
- "Understanding Python Dataflow Made Easy"

---

## Comparison to Original Name

### Why flowslice > PySlice

1. **No name conflict**: "flowslice" taken by template engine
2. **More descriptive**: "flow" adds meaning
3. **Language-agnostic**: Could expand beyond Python later
4. **Professional**: Combines two CS terms properly
5. **Available everywhere**: No platform conflicts

### Why Not "python" Prefix

Following industry best practices:
- ✅ `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest` - no "python" prefix
- ✅ Context makes language obvious (PyPI, docs, imports)
- ✅ Shorter CLI commands
- ✅ More professional sound
- ✅ Future flexibility

---

## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Install
pip install flowslice

# Analyze variable dataflow
flowslice mycode.py:42:user_input backward
flowslice mycode.py:10:config forward
flowslice mycode.py:100:result both

# Get help
flowslice --help
```

### Python API Usage
```python
# Import
import flowslice
from flowslice import Slicer

# Analyze
slicer = Slicer('myproject/')
result = slicer.slice('main.py', 42, 'var', direction='both')

# Display
print(result.as_tree())
```

### Documentation References

# Using flowslice for Debugging

flowslice is a dataflow analysis tool...

Install with: `pip install flowslice`
```

## Next Steps (Phase 1 Preparation)

### Immediate Updates:

1. ✅ **Decision made**: flowslice (DONE)
2. ⏭️ **Update docs**: Change all "PySlice" → "flowslice"
3. ⏭️ **Rename POC**: flowslice_poc.py → flowslice_poc.py
4. ⏭️ **Update code**: Docstrings, comments, CLI messages

### Platform Reservations:

5. ⏭️ **Reserve PyPI**: Create placeholder package
6. ⏭️ **Create GitHub org**: github.com/flowslice
7. ⏭️ **Register domain**: flowslice.dev
8. ⏭️ **Initialize repo**: With proper structure

### Phase 1 Kickoff:

9. ⏭️ **Set up package**: src/flowslice/ structure
10. ⏭️ **Start development**: Core library refactoring

## Research Journey Summary

### Phase 1: Initial Research (Oct 2-3)
- Tested 200+ names manually
- Used flawed curl testing (all appeared taken)
- Nearly gave up on good names

### Phase 2: Corrected Testing (Oct 27)
- Fixed testing methodology
- Discovered 67 names actually available
- Hope restored!

### Phase 3: Scope Filtering (Oct 27)
- Filtered 67 names by project alignment
- Narrowed to 4 top candidates
- Questioned intuitiveness

### Phase 4: Stylistic Exploration (Oct 27)
- Explored FlowSlice, FloSlyx, FloSlice
- Analyzed CamelCase vs unique variations
- Built decision framework

### Phase 5: Final Decision (Oct 27)
- Chose flowslice for clarity and professionalism
- Confident in choice
- Ready to build!

## Key Learnings

1. **Testing methodology matters** - Initial curl test was completely wrong
2. **User feedback is critical** - User caught the testing flaw
3. **Scope alignment essential** - Most available names didn't fit purpose
4. **Clarity > Creativity for dev tools** - Professional adoption requires clear names
5. **Decision frameworks help** - Systematic analysis beats gut feeling alone

- NAME_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md

All superseded by this final decision.

## Confidence Level

**Decision Confidence**: 95%

**Why so confident**:
- ✅ Extensive research (300+ names tested)
- ✅ Systematic evaluation (multiple frameworks)
- ✅ Clear alignment with project goals
- ✅ Fits Python ecosystem patterns
- ✅ Available on all platforms
- ✅ Professional and future-proof

**The 5% doubt**: "Could a more unique name have been cooler?"
**But**: Quality of tool matters infinitely more than coolness of name.
